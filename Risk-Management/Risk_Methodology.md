# Risk Methodology

## Purpose
Define a consistent method to identify, analyze, evaluate, and treat information security risks.

## Framework Alignment
- **NIST CSF 2.0**: Govern/Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**: Clause 6.1 (risk management) and Annex A controls

## Process
1. **Context** – Define assets, business processes, data classifications.
2. **Identify** – Threats, vulnerabilities, existing controls.
3. **Analyze** – Likelihood (1–5) × Impact (1–5) = **Risk Score (1–25)**.
4. **Evaluate** – Categorize as **Low (≤8), Medium (9–15), High (≥16)**; compare to risk appetite.
5. **Treat** – Choose: **Avoid**, **Reduce**, **Transfer**, or **Accept**. Create a **Risk Treatment Plan**.
6. **Monitor** – Track status; verify implemented controls; re-score residual risk.
7. **Communicate** – Report to leadership; update register and plan.

## Scoring Guidance
- **Likelihood**: 1 Rare, 2 Unlikely, 3 Possible, 4 Likely, 5 Almost Certain
- **Impact**: 1 Negligible, 2 Minor, 3 Moderate, 4 Major, 5 Severe

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Risk Owner**: Accountable for treatment and timeline
- **Security Team**: Facilitation, guidance, verification
- **Leadership**: Approves acceptance and budget

## Review Cadence
- **High**: monthly
- **Medium**: quarterly
- **Low**: semi-annually

## Records
- Risk Register (Excel)
- Risk Treatment Plan (Markdown)
- Evidence of implemented controls (tickets, screenshots, configs)
