- `IR_Tabletop_Scenario.md`
- `IR_After_Action_Report.pdf`  (tabletop outcomes)

**Focus:** NIST 800-61 lifecycle, roles & responsibilities, tabletop design, and after-action reporting.

Define the IR process (prepare â†’ detect â†’ contain â†’ eradicate â†’ recover â†’ lessons learned) and validate it via tabletop exercises with documented outcomes.

**Summary:**  
This section demonstrates that IR is operationalized at the program level: clear playbooks, realistic exercises, and measurable improvements captured in after-action reporting for governance review.
