## About This Portfolio  
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to design and implement Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) artifacts aligned with industry frameworks such as **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0), ISO/IEC 27001:2022, SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria, and PCI DSS v4.0**.  

It highlights my skills in:  
- Policy development  
- Risk assessment and treatment  
- Compliance control mapping  
- Vendor risk management  
- Gap analysis & remediation planning  
- Incident response design and testing  

Each artifact includes both **technical deliverables (Markdown, Excel)** for GitHub and **executive-ready reports (PDF)** for recruiters and leadership review.
